## 📝 Problem Description

Given an array `arr[]` of positive integers where every element appears **even times except for one**, find the number occurring an **odd number of times**.

---

## 📌 Examples

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`

**Output:**  
`2`

**Explanation:** All elements appear twice except `2`, which appears three times.

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 1]`

**Output:**  
`1`

**Explanation:** All elements appear twice except `1`, which appears once.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5`

---

## ⚡ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 🚀 My Approach

- Use the XOR operation:
  - XOR of a number with itself is `0`.
  - XOR of a number with `0` is the number itself.
- Iterate through the array and XOR all elements; the result is the single number occurring an odd number of times.

## 💻 Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int getSingle(vector<int>& arr) {
        int ans = arr[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
            ans = ans ^ arr[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
