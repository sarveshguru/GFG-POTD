## 📝 Problem Description

Given an array `arr` of distinct integers. Rearrange the array such that:

- The first element is the largest.
- The second element is the smallest.
- The third element is the second largest.
- The fourth element is the second smallest, and so on.

---

## 📌 Examples

**Input:**  
arr[] = [7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

**Output:**  
[7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]

**Explanation:**  
The first element is the maximum, second is the minimum, third is the second maximum, fourth is the second minimum, and so on.

**Input:**  
arr[] = [1, 6, 9, 4, 3, 7, 8, 2]

**Output:**  
[9, 1, 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4]

**Explanation:**  
The first element is the maximum, second is the minimum, and so on.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- \(1 \leq arr.size() \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^5\)

---

## ⚡ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

## 💡 My Approach

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Use two pointers: one at the beginning (`i`), and one at the end (`n`).
3. Pick the largest element, then the smallest, then the second largest, then the second smallest, and so on.
4. Push elements into a new array `ans`.
5. Return `ans`.

## 💻 Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> alternateSort(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Sort array in ascending order
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        vector<int> ans;

        int i = 0, n = arr.size() - 1;
        while (i <= n) {
            ans.push_back(arr[n]);
            if (i == n) break;
            ans.push_back(arr[i]);
            i++;
            n--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
