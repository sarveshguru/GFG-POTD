## 📝 Problem Description

Given head of a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

---

## 📌 Examples

**Input:**  
head : 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

**Output:**  
5

**Explanation:**  
Length of the linked list is 5, as there are 5 nodes present in it.

---

**Input:**  
head : 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 -> 5 -> 1 -> 0

**Output:**  
7

**Explanation:**  
Length of the linked list is 7, as there are 7 nodes present in it.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{number of nodes} \leq 4 \times 10^4\)
- \(1 \leq \text{node->data} \leq 10^3\)

---

## ⚡ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## 💡 My Approach

- Start with a counter initialized to zero.
- Traverse through the linked list node by node.
- Increment the counter for each node visited.
- Return the counter value once traversal reaches the end.

## 💻 Code (C++)

```cpp
/* Link list node */
/* struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
}; */

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    int getCount(struct Node* head) {
        int cnt = 0;
        while (head) {
            ++cnt;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
