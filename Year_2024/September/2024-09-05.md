## 📌 Problem Statement

You are given two sorted arrays `arr1[]` & `arr2[]` of distinct elements.  
The first array has **one element extra** added in between.  
Return the **index of the extra element**.

**Note:** 0-based indexing is followed.

## ✨ Examples

**Input:**  
`a[] = [2,4,6,8,9,10,12]`  
`b[] = [2,4,6,8,10,12]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
In the first array, `9` is extra and its index is `4`.

---

**Input:**  
`a[] = [3,5,7,8,11,13]`  
`b[] = [3,5,7,11,13]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
In the first array, `8` is extra and its index is `3`.

---

**Input:**  
`a[] = [3,5]`  
`b[] = [3]`  
**Output:**  
`1`  
**Explanation:**  
In the first array, `5` is extra and its index is `1`.

---

## 🎯 Constraints

- `2 <= arr1.size() <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^6`

---

## ⏱️ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`
- **Auxiliary Space**: `O(1)`

---

## 🧠 My Approach

1. Use **binary search** to find the index where the arrays differ.
2. If `arr1[mid] == arr2[mid]`, then the extra element must be in the right half.
3. Otherwise, it lies in the left half.
4. Return the index where the mismatch occurs.

## 🖥️ Code Implementation

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findExtra(int n, int arr1[], int arr2[]) {
        // add code here.
        int start_index = 0, end_index = n - 1;
        while(start_index <= end_index){
            int mid = (end_index - start_index) / 2 + start_index;
            if(arr2[mid] == arr1[mid]){
                start_index = mid + 1;
            } else {
                end_index = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return start_index;
    }
};
```
