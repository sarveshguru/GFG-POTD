## 📝 Problem Description

Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its **Mirror tree**.

The **Mirror of a Binary Tree T** is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.

---

## 📌 Examples

**Input:**  
root[] = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]

**Output:**  
[1, 3, 2, N, 4]

**Explanation:**  
In the mirrored tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.

**Input:**  
root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

**Output:**  
[1, 3, 2, N, N, 5, 4]

**Explanation:**  
In the mirrored tree, all left and right children are swapped.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- \(1 \leq \text{number of nodes} \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq \text{node->data} \leq 10^5\)

---

## ⚡ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(h) (where h = height of tree, recursion stack)

---

### My Approach

- I used a **recursive traversal** approach.
- At each node:
  - Swap the **left** and **right** children.
  - Recursively call the function for the left and right subtrees.
- Base case: If the node is `NULL`, simply return.
- This ensures that at every level, children are swapped, thus forming the mirror tree.

## 💻 Code (C++)

```cpp
/* A binary tree node has data,
   pointer to left child and a pointer to right child
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    struct Node* right;
    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        left = right = NULL;
    }
}; */

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        if (!node) return;

        // swap left and right
        Node* temp = node->left;
        node->left = node->right;
        node->right = temp;

        // recursive calls
        mirror(node->left);
        mirror(node->right);
    }
};
```
