## 📝 Problem Description

Given an array `height` representing the heights of buildings, count the number of buildings that will **see the sunrise**.

- The sun rises from the **left side** of the array.
- A building can see the sunrise if its height is **strictly greater** than all buildings to its left.

---

## 📌 Examples

**Input:**  
`height = [7, 4, 8, 2, 9]`

**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**

- 7 sees the sun → count = 1
- 4 is blocked by 7 → ignored
- 8 sees the sun → count = 2
- 2 is blocked → ignored
- 9 sees the sun → count = 3

**Input:**  
`height = [2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**  
All buildings are taller than their left neighbors → all see the sun.

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- \(1 \leq height.size() \leq 10^6\)
- \(1 \leq height[i] \leq 10^8\)

---

## ⚡ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### 🚀 My Approach

- Maintain a variable `mxm` to track the **maximum height** seen so far.
- Iterate through the array:
  - If current building `i > mxm`, it can see the sun → increment count.
  - Update `mxm` with the current height if it is greater.

## 💻 Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    // Returns count of buildings that can see sunlight
    int countBuildings(vector<int> &height) {
        int mxm = INT_MIN;
        int cnt = 0;

        for(int h : height){
            if(h > mxm){
                cnt++;
                mxm = h;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};

```
