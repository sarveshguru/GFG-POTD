## Examples

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]  
**Output:** 1

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
**Output:** 3

## Constraints

- 1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5

---

## Expected Complexities

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int maxStep(vector<int>& arr) {
        int i = 0, j = 1;
        int c = 0, mx = 0;
        while (j < arr.size()) {
            if (arr[j-1] < arr[j]) {
                c++;
                j++;
            } else {
                mx = max(mx, c);
                c = 0;
                i = j;
                j++;
            }
        }
        mx = max(mx, c);
        return mx;
    }
};
