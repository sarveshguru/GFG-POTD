## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find its **height**.

- The **height of a tree** is the number of **edges** on the longest path from the root to a leaf node.
- A **leaf node** is a node that does not have any children.

---

## ✨ Examples

**Input:**  
`root = [12, 8, 18, 5, 11]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
One of the longest paths from the root (node `12`) goes through node `8` to node `5`, which has `2` edges.

**Input:**  
`root = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, N, 5, N, N, 6, 7]`  
**Output:**  
`3`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest path from the root (node `1`) to a leaf node (`6`) has `3` edges.

---

## 🎯 Constraints

- `1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5`
- `0 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^5`

---

## ⏱️ Expected Complexities

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
- **Auxiliary Space**: `O(h)` (recursive stack, where `h` is the height of the tree)

---

## 🧠 My Approach

1. The problem requires finding the **longest root-to-leaf path** in terms of edges.
2. Using recursion:
   - If the current node is `NULL`, return `-1` (since we count edges, not nodes).
   - Otherwise, compute the height of both left and right subtrees.
   - Take the **maximum** of the two and add `1`.
3. This guarantees that we always calculate the longest edge path from root to leaf.

## 🖥️ Code Implementation

```cpp
// User function template for C++

/* class Node {
 public:
     int data;
     Node* left;
     Node* right;
     Node(int val) {
         data = val;
         left = right = NULL;
     }
 }; */

class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the height of a binary tree.
    int height(Node* node) {
        // code here
        if(node) return max(height(node->left), height(node->right))+1;
        return -1;
    }
};
```
